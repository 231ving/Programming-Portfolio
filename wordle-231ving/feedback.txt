* Good start on part 1 and 2. Please continue to work at getting all the boxes at the top the same size
  (so that everything lines up)
* Nice work getting the various boxes colored correctly. Next time, I would encourage you to look 
  for a design that requires less "code" in the template.  Here is one idea:  For the keyboard
  create a Dictionary that maps letters to the correct class.  That way, you don't need so may 
  "if" statements in the template. Instead you can just pull the desired class values right out of the 
  dictionary. 

  (Do this once, instead of having an if-else chain.)
  <span id="letter-{{ char }}" class="{{char_map[char]}}">{{ char.upper() }}</span>


  There is no need to refactor the template; but please re-submit the HTML (either in the context
  of part 1, or part2, your choice)
